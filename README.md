# Florida Springs Deep Dive
# Description
This project has the best Springs in Florida. The user can create an account to save his favorite springs, create reviews, and see other people's reviews. We created our own server, and we have routes to different screens like the homepage, the favorites, the login, register, and the individual spring.

# Installation
The user need to click in the link that takes him to the website. There is a login link where the user can access to his account, then in the favorite section there are the favorite springs. When he clicks on the image, he is taken to that individual spring and he has more details about the spring, a video about it, photos, and reviews. He can also add a review in that page.
