# Installation
The user need to click in the link that takes him to the website. There is a login link where the user can access to his account, then in the favorite section there are the favorite springs. When he clicks on the image, he is taken to that individual spring and he has more details about the spring, a video about it, photos, and reviews. He can also add a review in that page.
